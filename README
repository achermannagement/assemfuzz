# assem-fuzz

This is a project to make a fuzzing platform for the Hack assembly platform from the Nand2Tetris (http://nand2tetris.org/) series.

## Getting Started

Download the Nand2Tetris Software Suite to grab the reference assembler.

### Prerequisites

Nand2Tetris Software Suite: (http://nand2tetris.org/software.php)

### Installing

This will give an example of how to use the program by changing it to fuzz the reference compiler against itself on a linux system.

Unzip the software suite.

```
cd ~/Downloads
unzip nand2tetris.zip
```

Clone the repo.

```
git clone https://github.com/achermannagement/assem-fuzz.git
```

Make two directories.

```
cd assem-fuzz
mkdir mine
mkdir theirs
```

Move the tools into both folders as executable.

```
cd ..
cp -r nand2tetris/tools/* assem-fuzz/mine
cp -r nand2tetris/tools/* assem-fuzz/theirs
cd assem-fuzz
chmod +x mine/Assembler.sh
chmod +x theirs/Assembler.sh
```

Update the RUN_STRING in definitions.py
```
RUN_STRING = "{}/{}.sh {}".format(MY_FOLDER, PATH_TO_ASSEMBLER, PATH_TO_TEST_FILE)
```

Run the program

```
python3 assem-fuzz.py
Test passed
All tests passed? True
```

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
